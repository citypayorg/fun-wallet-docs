# Layouts

We use [Angular Flex layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/flex-layout) for all our view components. This is built and maintained by the Angular team themselves, with thousands of tests and support for every single browser, allowing us to build views with confidence it will look the same everywhere.
