# KYC

We supply a KYC integration which all dapps can hook on to and use. We use 2 providers, [YotiDocScan](https://business.yoti.com/doc-scan/) and [Trulioo](https://id.trulioo.com/identity-verification-service-demo.html?ads_cmpid=1695413170&ads_adid=66837987260&ads_matchtype=e&ads_network=g&ads_creative=409220715117&utm_term=trulioo&ads_targetid=kwd-372351914628&utm_campaign=branding&utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_content=branding&ttv=2&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2OX5g_7T6QIVC-ztCh1f7gMcEAAYAiAAEgI2PPD_BwE).

We mainly use YotiDocScan which covers over 200 countries, our integration allows the user to upload their passport, driving license or national id which the UI is all handled for you. The beauty of our KYC integration is the dapp can control if its required or not. The wallet has no hard constraints on certain aspects which gives complete flexibility.
