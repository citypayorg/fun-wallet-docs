# Our Testing

Here at FunFair Wallet we are huge lovers of unit tests. We have 90% coverage overall and on all the super-important things on the Wallet (like signing) we have 100% coverage. We also have integration tests for signing and other Wallet functionality.

Our QA team provides sign-off on any changes before they go live.

This gives us a great deal of confidence that new releases won't introduce regressions or unexpected behaviour.
