# Branding

Our wallet is brandable, we use angular material for all our components which leads us to use angulars theming to allow everything to be branded. We would generate our dapp integrators a palette which would allow them to define a primary colour, secondary colour and if it should be a dark or light theme. More information about this can be found [here](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes)
