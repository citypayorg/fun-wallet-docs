# Branding

Our Wallet is brandable: we use Angular Material UI for all our components which leads us to use Angular's theming, allowing everything to be branded. 

We would generate our dApp integrators a palette which would allow them to define a primary and secondary colours, and whether a dark or light theme should be used. 

More information about this can be found [here](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes).
