# Auto-resizing of iframes

As you may know, the parent cannot know the context of the child it has iframed in. This is standard cross-site protection which is a universal principle of Internet security. But if you don't know the content of the iframe, how do you know the height of it? Well, the good news is you don't need to worry about that, the SDK takes care of this for you and auto-resizes the UI anytime the height changes.
