# Introduction

We provide a set of endpoints which can be called using any HTTP client in order to obtain in-depth information about your dApp's Wallet users. 

These endpoints are intended to allow your server-side code to retrieve canonical information about individual users based on a supplied user account address.

We currently offer two endpoints:
1. [ User information: KYC status, self-exclusion and marketing opt-in status ](./user-information.md)
2. [ Encrypted user information, providing a user's name, date of birth and country code, with the data encrypted in transit ](./encrypted-user-information.md)
