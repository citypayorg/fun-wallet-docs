# Languages

## Supported Languages

The wallet currently supports:

```
- en - english
- ja - japanese
```

Other languages can be added on request.

## Setting Language

You can set what language you want the wallet to run on. The default is English and if you do not pass it a langugage it will default back to that. Just call this at the top of your `<body>` and your language will change to `japanese` in this example.

```ts
window.funwallet.setLanguage('ja');
```
