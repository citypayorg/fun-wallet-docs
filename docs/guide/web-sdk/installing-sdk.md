# Installing the FunFair Wallet SDK

## NPM

```bash
$ npm install @funfair-tech/wallet-sdk
```

## YARN

```bash
$ yarn add @funfair-tech/wallet-sdk
```

## Peer Dependencies

```json
"post-robot": "9.0.36"
```

### NPM

```bash
$ npm install post-robot@9.0.36
```

### YARN

```bash
$ yarn add post-robot@9.0.36
```

It should be fine to use the latest version of [post-robot](https://github.com/krakenjs/post-robot); however, if you're only installing it to allow the SDK to work then we recommend installing the exact version that's referenced.
