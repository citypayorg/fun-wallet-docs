# FunFair Wallet SDK

## Information

ðŸ’¡ The SDK is only ever linked to the leader instance.

ðŸ’¡ All communication goes from the leader > SDK.

ðŸ’¡ If the follower needs to emit, say, some tracking information, the flow would be:
`Follower emits tracking event` > `Leader picks it up emits it to` > `SDK` > `dapp`

ðŸ’¡ This way we only ever have one thing in control and the leader is the master in all of this.

ðŸ’¡ The leader speaks to the SDK for internal tasks without the dApp needing to do anything.

ðŸ’¡ The leader keeps the iframe height in sync.

ðŸ’¡ As it's embedded in the dApp it has super powers, like storage and other things.

ðŸ’¡ The leader is exposed on the window for easy web use.

ðŸ’¡ It supports full typings.

ðŸ’¡ It handles web3 or etherjs libraries.

ðŸ’¡ Script is referenced to a place in the Wallet, so we can deploy fixes and new features without having to make every dApp update their package. The NPM package is just enums and typings.

ðŸ’¡ We use [post-robot](https://github.com/krakenjs/post-robot) to perform nice communication with full compile time errors.
