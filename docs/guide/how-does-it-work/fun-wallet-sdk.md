# FunWallet SDK

## Information

ğŸ’¡ The SDK is only ever linked to the leader instance

ğŸ’¡ All communication goes from the leader > sdk

ğŸ’¡ If the follower needs to emit say for example some tracking information the flow would be:
`Follower emits tracking event` > `Leader picks it up emits it to` > `SDK` > `dapp`

ğŸ’¡ This way we only ever have 1 thing in control and the leader is the master in all of this.

ğŸ’¡ Leader speaks to the sdk for internal tasks without the dapp doing anything.

ğŸ’¡ Keeps the iframe height in sync.

ğŸ’¡ As it is embedded in the dapp it has super powers like storage and other things.

ğŸ’¡ Exposed on the window for easy web use.

ğŸ’¡ Supports full typings.

ğŸ’¡ Handles web3 or ethers libs.

ğŸ’¡ Script is referenced to a place in fun wallet so we can deploy fixes and new features without having to make every dapp update their package. The NPM package is just enums and typings.

ğŸ’¡ Use postrobot to perform nice communication with full compile time errors.
