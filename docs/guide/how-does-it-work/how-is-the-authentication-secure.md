# How is the Authentication Secure?

ðŸ’¡ Encryption logic makes it impossible to retrieve the master key without the user's email address and password.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ *The server never knows a user's password.*

ðŸ’¡ If you know the password you can always generate the same master key which encrypted the encrypted private key which is saved on the server.

ðŸ’¡ Your authentication token is a hash of your master key, so you can only get back to that if you can generate a master key using a password.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ If this matches whatâ€™s on the server, you know this person can be logged in to your dApp.

ðŸ’¡ The server at this point can return the encrypted private key and the IV, and this can only be decrypted using the master key.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ Whoop! You have your private key in memory, so you're able to sign data without anyone else seeing it.
