# How Is The Authentication Secure?

ðŸ’¡ Encryption logic makes it impossible for you to get back to the master key without the email address and password.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ Server never knows password

ðŸ’¡ If you know the password you can always generate the same master key which encrypted the encrypted private key which is saved on the server.

ðŸ’¡ Your authentication token is a hash of your master key again you can only get back to that if you can generate your master key.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ If this matches whatâ€™s on the server you know this person can be logged in

ðŸ’¡ The server at this point can return you the encrypted private key and the iv and you can only decrypt this if you have the master key.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ Whoop you have your private key in memory to be able to sign stuff without anyone else seeing it.
