# FunFair Wallet Ethereum Provider

## What is an Ethereum Provider?

ðŸ’¡ Most dApps use either web3 or etherjs to read from and write to the blockchain directly from the client.

ðŸ’¡ These libraries follow best practices, and expose interfaces that should allow you to do everything necessary for blockchain development.

ðŸ’¡ Also, the nodes and signing all need to happen in the Wallet client not the dApp client as only the Wallet client has access to the necessary context information.

ðŸ’¡ An Ethereum provider is something you can inject into the constructor of web3 or etherjs and override the point at which it makes the JSON-RPC call.

ðŸ’¡ Minimal changes, if any, should be required to the web3/etherjs code.

ðŸ’¡ Once done, our Ethereum provider will proxy all the JSON-RPC calls to the Wallet.
