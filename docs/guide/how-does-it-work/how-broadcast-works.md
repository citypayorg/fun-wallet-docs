# How Broadcast Works?

ðŸ’¡ All of these messages are done in a synchronous way.

ðŸ’¡ Leader requests follower to create a RSA key pair > follower generates and sends back to leader > so on..
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ A set of guidelines it has to follow before moving on this allows us to do nice task easier speaking to an authenticated instance from a unauthenticated instance.

ðŸ’¡ Each tab session instance can speak to each other aka all leader and follower and popup instances linked to the tab have a identifier to communicate.

ðŸ’¡ Tab > Tab can not speak, well it technically can but we do not let that happen.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ This allows someone to be able to be logged in to the same dapp on different tabs and 1 tab does not affect the other tab user experience.
