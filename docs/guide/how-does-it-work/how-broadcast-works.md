# How Broadcast Works

*All of these messages are exchanged synchronously.*

ðŸ’¡ Leader requests follower to create a RSA key pair > follower generates and sends back to leader > and so on...
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ It follows a set of rules before moving on, allowing us to more easily handle communication to an authenticated instance from an unauthenticated instance.

ðŸ’¡ Each tab session instance can speak to each other one, i.e. all leader and follower and popup instances linked to the tab use an identifier to allow communication.

ðŸ’¡ Tab-to-tab communication is prevented.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡ This allows someone to be able to be logged in to the same dApp on different tabs and one tab does not affect any instances loaded in other tabs.
