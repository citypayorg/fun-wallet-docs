# How Authentication Works

ðŸ’¡ Wallet server never sees the private key due to encryption.

ðŸ’¡ Private key is held in memory of the Wallet client which is protected by standard cross-site and Internet security.

ðŸ’¡ An invisible iframe is embedded in the top of the page. We call this the `leader`, since itâ€™s in charge of signing stuff and also in charge of spawning new UI elements and all approval modals. It never gets removed from the DOM.

ðŸ’¡ Once loaded, dApps can hook onto all the message listeners which are exposed by the SDK.

ðŸ’¡ On click of the sign-in / up button, the dApp client calls the SDK to popup the authentication view. The embedded leader creates a secure encrypted communication channel with the authentication popup, passing a public RSA key to the authentication popup.

ðŸ’¡ Sign-in / Register / Recovery actions happen, and the popup now holds all the authentication context. It then encrypts all of the authenticated data with the RSA public key the leader supplied and broadcasts it to the leader instance. At this point the leader is authenticated and can do the necessary signing.
